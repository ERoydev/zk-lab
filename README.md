# zk-Knowledge Education Collection

This repository is dedicated to collecting educational resources, experiments, and notes about zero-knowledge (zk) technologies, including circuits, proof systems, and related tooling. Here you'll find:

- Example circuits and proof workflows
- Experiments with different zk backends and libraries
- Notes and documentation for learning and reference
- Scripts and code samples for hands-on exploration

## Versions

At the time of writing, be mindful that each backend for proofs requires a different version of Noir:
- **Sunspot** → Requires Noir 1.0.0-beta.13
- **Barretenberg** → Requires Noir 1.0.0-beta.3 for Barretenberg 0.82.2
